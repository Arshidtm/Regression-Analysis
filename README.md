# Regression Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of Regression Analysis, a powerful statistical and machine learning technique used for modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables. The project delves into different regression models, their fitting, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand and apply various regression models on a dataset, analyzing the influence of predictors on the target variable and evaluating model performance using key metrics.

## Key Concepts in Regression Analysis

### What is Regression Analysis?

**Regression Analysis** is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The goal is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied while the other independent variables are held fixed.

### Types of Regression Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: Models a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends linear regression by incorporating multiple predictors.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Models non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial terms of the independent variables.
- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Regularization techniques to reduce overfitting in linear regression.
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary classification): Models the probability of a binary outcome.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Loading the dataset into a DataFrame.
   - Checking data structure, types, and handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables (if applicable) and normalizing/scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots.
   - Identifying key features affecting the target variable.

3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Fitting various regression models using libraries like `scikit-learn`.
   - Comparing model performance based on evaluation metrics.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - **RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**
   - Analyzing residuals to check for patterns.

5. **Regularization Techniques**
   - Implementing Ridge and Lasso regression to prevent overfitting.
   - Visualizing how coefficients shrink with regularization.




### Prerequisites

- Required libraries can be installed using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```


## Visualization

- **Regression Line Plot**: Displays the fit of the regression line.
- **Residual Plot**: Examines errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Coefficient Plot**: Visualizes the magnitude of feature impact in regularized models.
- **Predicted vs. Actual Plot**: Compares predicted values with actual target values.

## Applications of Regression Analysis

- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting sales, predicting prices, etc.
- **Trend Analysis**: Understanding trends over time.
- **Impact Analysis**: Quantifying the effect of one or more predictors on the target variable.
